# Mobify Navitron

A mobile optimized sliding navigation plugin.


### Grunt Tasks:
* `grunt` or `grunt build` - builds a distributable release
* `grunt watch` - watches for changes and builds when changes are detected. 
* `grunt serve` - runs the server, building changes and then watching for changes. Use grunt serve to preview the site at **http://localhost:3000**
* `grunt test` - runs the test suite in your console
* `grunt test:browser` - runs a server that allows you to run the test suite in your browser


The `dist` directory will be populated with minified versions of the css and javascript files for distribution and use with whatever build system you might use. The `src` directory has our raw unminified Sass and Javascript files if you prefer to work with those.
